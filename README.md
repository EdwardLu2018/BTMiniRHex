# BTMiniRHex
iOS application for controlling CMU's [Robomechanics](https://www.cmu.edu/me/robomechanicslab/) lab's [MiniRHex](https://github.com/robomechanics/MiniRHex) using Bluetooth.

This repo has been depreciated. Updated code has been moved to [https://github.com/robomechanics/MobiMini](https://github.com/robomechanics/MobiMini).

The MiniRHex needs the [BT-410 Bluetooth module](http://www.robotis.us/bt-410/) from Robotis in order to connect with an iPhone.
